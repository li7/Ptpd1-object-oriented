initData:
init data initializes the parameters of the clock. Really simple, can even be
done in a constructor maybe.

m1: sets the master data set.

s1: sets the slave data set.

copyD0: 
copies the parameters of one to another.

getIdentifier: identifies what the device is?

bmcDataSetComparison:
compares the data of the two sets, data of how the bmc algorithm selects which
is the better device to use as a master

bmcStateDecision:
decides what the next state of the device is, master,slave,listening,etc

bmc: runs the whole algorithm
